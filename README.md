This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Tcl related to the `puts stderr` command and variable substitution.  The `bug.tcl` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.tcl` provides the corrected version.  The issue arises from how Tcl handles variable substitution within double quotes when using `puts stderr`. The solution involves using the `subst` command to properly perform variable substitution before printing to stderr.
